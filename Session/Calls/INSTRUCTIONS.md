#  Building SignalRingRTC

A pre-built version of the SignalRingRTC framework is included so that not everyone who checks out the Session iOS repo has to rebuild it (doing that takes a long time). If, however, you want to rebuild the SignalRingRTC framework, you can find instructions on how to do that here: https://github.com/signalapp/ringrtc/blob/master/BUILDING.md .
